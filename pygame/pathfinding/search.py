'''
Next move for Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is to use the cost of movement for each stage, the queue needs to come from a different order and the search tracks the costs into the queue.

With a function Gridwithweights() we can get the weights from each edge.
A lower number(weight) is made priority into the queue.

To order queues well we use tuples (priority, item) in the function.
